 Restaurant Management System

The Restaurant Management System is a Java-based application that leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to simulate and manage the operations of a restaurant. 
This system is designed to handle various functionalities required for efficient restaurant management, ensuring a smooth and streamlined process.

 Features

1. Menu Management:
   - Add, update, or remove menu items.
   - Categorize menu items (e.g., appetizers, main course, desserts, beverages).
   - Display the complete menu with prices and descriptions.

2. Order Management:
   - Take and manage customer orders.
   - Handle multiple orders simultaneously.
   - Generate order summaries and calculate total bills.

3. Reservation System:
   - Book and manage table reservations.
   - Check table availability in real-time.

4. Staff Management:
   - Add and manage staff details (e.g., name, role, contact information).
   - Assign tasks to staff members.

5. Billing System:
   - Automatically calculate bills based on orders.
   - Apply discounts, taxes, and service charges.
   - Generate and print customer receipts.

6. Inventory Management:
   - Track ingredients and supplies.
   - Notify when stock levels are low.

7. Customer Feedback:
   - Allow customers to provide feedback and ratings.
   - Store feedback for future analysis.

 Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Java
- Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- Data Storage: File handling for saving and retrieving data (e.g., menu items, orders, reservations).

How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
3. Compile the Java files using the following command:
   
   javac Main.java
   
4. Run the application using:
   
   java Main
   
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the system.

## OOP Concepts in Action

1. Classes and Objects:
   - Separate classes for Menu, Order, Reservation, Staff, and Inventory.
   - Objects created for each entity to manage specific tasks.

2. Inheritance:
   - Base classes for common functionalities (e.g., Person class for staff and customers).

3. Polymorphism:
   - Method overloading and overriding for flexibility in functionality.

4. Encapsulation:
   - Private attributes with public getter and setter methods for secure data handling.

5. Abstraction:
   - Abstract classes and interfaces for defining general behavior while allowing specific implementations.

Future Improvements

- Integration with a database for persistent storage.
- Addition of a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
- Enhanced reporting and analytics features.
- Online ordering and delivery tracking system.
